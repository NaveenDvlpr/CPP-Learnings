// Operator Overloading allows to define functions using operators instead of function name
// Operator Overloading avoids the problem of access of operators on the objects
// The motto is to use the operators on objects as like primitive operands on operators
// We can overload the existing operators only and we limitations also on this
// We must not have to change the principle of the operator
// The left side operand is user-defined operand
// Some of the operators are not overloaded expect scope operator(::), member access operator
// (.), (.*), sizeof(), conditional operator (?:)
// Operator Overloading should be done in class, Operator should be a member of the class
